# Covid19-Detector
***A Machine Learning Based Approach on Predicting COVID-19***

This repository summarizes that the patient is infected or not from COVID-19.

Firstly, we create a model for checking the probability of patient i.e,higher the probability
higher chances of infection.  
Secondly, after creating a model we integrate it into flask app and predicting the result for COVID19.

***Note:-*** I took a random data and arrange them properly and create a dataset.

## Tool
1) Python
2) Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
3) Sklearn for model building
4) Jupyter notebook, visual studio code
5) Python flask for http server
6) HTML/CSS
